# measurePSF

MATLAB routine to measure a microscope point-spread function (PSF) based upon an image-stack of a sub-micron bead. 
To run, add measurePSF to your path or ```cd``` to the directory containing the file. To run a demo, just run the command ```measurePSF```. You should then get a figure window much like the one below. Read the help text. 

The repository also contains ``Grid2MicsPerPixel``, which can be used to measure the x/y resolution of the microscope and contains a protocol with instructions on how to do this. 

The function has been tested on R2014a and R2015b.
