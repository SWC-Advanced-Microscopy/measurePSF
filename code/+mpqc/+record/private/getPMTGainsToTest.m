function gainsToTest = getPMTGainsToTest(numGains)
    % Generate a vector of PMT gains to test based on the PMT type
    %
    % Purpose
    % Records of the standard source in particular but perhaps also lens paper are
    % done over a range of gains. This function returns a set of gain values to record
    % based upon the PMT type. If the max control voltage is under 2V then it is assumed
    % we have a GaAsP, as those have max control voltage of around 0.9 to 1.5V. Also, if
    % the max voltage is 1 or 100 then it's also likely to be a GaAsP.
    % This function is shared across recording functions in case we need to synchronize
    % the gains at which data are acquired.
    %
    %
    % Inputs
    % numGains - (optional 12 by default) this is the number of gains to test.
    %            If numGains is empty or <0 then the default number of gains is used.
    %
    % Outputs
    % gainsToTest - a matrix where rows are different PMTs and columns are gains.
    %
    % % TODO ! include example output
