function lens_paper(varargin)
    % Image lens paper to generate raw data for assessing overall image quality
    %
    % function mpqc.record.lens_paper('power',value, 'wavelength', value, ...)
    %
    % Purpose
    % Lens paper (e.g. purchased from ThorLabs) is useful standard sample. It is
    % consistent from batch to batch, it contains structure, it bleaches slowly. Images
    % of lens paper show a sparse structure of fibres that do not dim rapidly with depth.
    % depth and anyway it is intrinsically pretty thin. Lens paper can easily be sealed
    % under a coverslip but note the paper must remain dry for imaging. Lens paper samples
    % can be assessed in two ways:
    % 1. Qualitatively. Here the user learns by experience that, say, a barely reasonable
    %   image of the lens tissue paper can be achieved at a power of 15 mW at the sample.
    %   Failure to get a decent image at that power would indicate a potential problem.
    % 2. Quantitatively. Here we would use a higher laser power, such as 50 to 100 mW, and
    %   analyse the data post-acquisition to calculate the mean number of photons emitted
    %   from the sample per pixel. If the same laser power is used each time, a deviation
    %   in mean photon count may indicate a problem with the microscope. A higher laser
    %   power is needed to provide a larger SNR for the measurement.
    %
    %
    % Inputs (optional param/val pairs. If not defined, a CLI prompt appears)
    %  'wavelength' - Excitation wavelength of the laser. Defined in nm.
    %  'power' - Power at the sample. Defined in mW.
    %
    % Inputs (optional, exact & case sensitive,  param/val pairs)
    %  'nFames' - The number of frames to acquire. If not defined a reasonable value is
    %           chosen: the larger of 40 frames or 5 seconds of data.
    %  'numGains' - The number of PMT gains at which to record the data. If not defined,
    %               the current PMT gains are used and one set of images obtained only. If
    %               "numGains" is non empty and >1 then a series of recordings at
    %               different gains is made. NOTE: set numGains to -1 to use the default
    %               gains that are used for the standard light source.
    %               TODO -- IT SHOULD ALWAYS ASK FOR A GAIN AND SAVE TO FILE NAME!
    %
    % The channels to image is determined based on the channel selected to be saved
    % within ScanImage.
    %
    % Running the function
    % The wavelength and power inputs are required for the function to run. The user
    % must supply power and wavelengths as integer for logging purposes. If the user
    % does not define these as parameter/value pairs, they are prompted at CLI to do so.
    % The order of the two arguments does not matter.
    %
    %
    % e.g. In the following example the user is imaging at 920 nm and 10 mW
    % at the sample.
    %
    % >> mpqc.record.lens_paper('wavelength',920,'power',10)
    %
    % e.g. If no inputs are given, user will be prompted for values
    % >> mpqc.record.lens_paper
