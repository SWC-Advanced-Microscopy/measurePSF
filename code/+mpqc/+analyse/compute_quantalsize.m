    % function result = mpqc.analyse.compute_quantalsize(frames, count_weight_gamma, min_count_proportion)
    %
    % Purpose
    % Compute the number of photons per pixel (the quantal size or system sensitivity) from
    % scanning microscope data. The input data (frames) should be a time series or Z-stack
    % that contains at least about 100 frames. The result can be affected by fluctuations in
    % laser power or contamination be electrical noise. Ensure the laser has stablised.
    % Clip beginning frames if necessary. Using moderately high PMT gains may be needed
    % if your system has appreciable noise after the amplification stage. e.g. with
    % multi-alkali PMTs set the gain to at least around 600 to 650V. Photons/pixel should
    % be constant over gain. You can generate a photons/pixel as a function of gain plot to
    % verify that your chosen gain is suitable.
    %
    %
    % Inputs (required)
    % frames: A time series or z stack in the format (height, width, time). Your data
    %   *must* contain a range of mean values and so ought to originate from imaging a
    %   structured sample. A self-luminous test target is not suitable, as all pixels will
    %   have the same mean value.
    %
    % Input (optional)
    %   count_weight_gamma: This setting influences the weighting of each count value in
    %     the robust regression. The default is 0.2. Use a weight of 0 (or a very small value)
    %     to weigh each intensity level equally. Use 1.0 to weigh each intensity in proportion
    %     to pixel counts. If unsure leave as default. You can verify the effect of this
    %     parameter by checking the fit with the plotPhotonFit function.
    %  min_count_proportion: This setting influences the magnitude of the smallest values
    %     that contribute to the fit. By default it is 0.07, meaning that the smallest values
    %     used for the fit will never be less than 7% of the maximum value used. If you see
    %     a peculiar shape in the distribution for low values with plotPhotonFit and this is
    %     throwing off the fit, you can increase the magnitude of this parameter.
    %
    %
    % Outputs
    %  result: A struct with fields:
    %         - model: The fitted regression model.
    %         - min_intensity: Minimum intensity used.
    %         - max_intensity: Maximum intensity used.
    %         - variance: Variances at intensity levels.
    %         - quantal_size: Sensitivity.
    %         - zero_level: X-intercept.
    %         - photons_per_pixel: The mean number of photons pixel in "frames"
    % dataForFit: The data that go into the fit
    %
    %
    % Example
    %  Run on a subset of frames then convert whole stack to photons. Note that the number
    %  of photons per pixel is typically very small. If taken from a multi-photon system,
    %  "Frames" is likely going to be int16 or possibly uint16. Once converted to photons
    %  the numbers will all be >=0 and likely very small. Data can therefore be converted
    %  to uint8. Note that to convert to photons we first subtract the zero (the X axis
    %  intercept) then divide by the quantal size.
    %
    %  >> result = compute_quantalsize(frames(:,:,1000:1150));
    %  >> dataInPhotonsPerPixel = (frames-result.zero_level) / result.quantal_size;
