## Manually setting up ScanImage to record a PSF with averaging
These instructions explain how to set up ScanImage to obtain an averaged fast z stack. 
These instructions are pretty much what `record.PSF` does, so if that's not working for you just follow the steps below.

* Using the slow-z device and reading its position, determine the depth at which you wish to start imaging and note how far below it you wish to go. 
* Place objective at the top of the stack you wish to acquire with the slow-z motor.
* Un-check the `Enable` box for the fast-z under `FAST Z CONTROLS`.
* In the same window set `# Slices` and `Step/Slice` (microns per step) to cover the range of depths you need. 
  Sampling every 0.25 microns is nice for a 2-photon z-stack. 
* In the same window set the `Scan Type` to `Step`.
* Check `Sec Z` in `MOTOR CONTROLS`.
* Set the `Frame Rolling Average Factor` in `IMAGE CONTROLS` to the number of frames you wish to average. 
  40 frames is probably good enough.
* Check `Save` in `MAIN CONTROLS` and set `# Avg` to the same number of frames (e.g. 40).
* Set the right-hand box in the `Frames Done` line in `MAIN CONTROLS` to the number of images you are averaging.
* Press `GRAB` in `MAIN CONTROLS` to acquire a stack
* If the shutter opening and closing is annoying then set `hSI.hStackManager.shutterCloseMinZStepSize` to a value larger than you step size.
