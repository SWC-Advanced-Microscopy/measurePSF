How to make an EM grid test slide for measuring FOV size


You can use a copper EM grid of known pitch to measure the FOV your microscope. 
We use part number 2145C from [2spi.com](http://www.2spi.com/category/grids)
These grids have a pitch of 25 microns with 19 micron holes. 
To set up the grid on a slide:

* Use a dissection scope and forceps to position the grid on a glass slide such that the grid lines are square with the edges of the slide. 
This will make positioning the grid under the microscope a lot easier. 
* Place a coverslip over the grid and seal with nail varnish.
