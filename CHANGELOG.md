Merge of a bunch of recent changes by Rob Campbell
* General doc text tidying. 
* Add `CONTRIBUTION_GUIDELINES.md`
* Made a standalone `CHANGELOG.md` and tidied it and improve formatting.
* Renamed repo to multiphoton-qc, mpsf -> mpqc
* Lens paper function now saves all channels.
* Standard source and lens paper produce more similar data (same pixel size)
* Dark noise is longer recorded along with electrical noise.
* Electrical noise function now saves all available channels automatically. 
* Added simple code in `tools` for converting the standard source to photons. 


### 2024/07/19
* NEW FEATURE: `mpsf.record` functions now all accept parameter/value pairs via standard interface.
Inputs that are required not supplied when the function is called are requested interactively at the CLI. Isabell Whitely [PR #70](https://github.com/SWC-Advanced-Microscopy/measurePSF/pull/70).
